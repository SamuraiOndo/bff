### TSC

| Format | Status |
|--------|--------|
| csc    | ✔      |
| psc    | ✔      |
| CPS    | ✔      |

These formats from Black Sheep Studios games also use the csc cypher and therefore work with the csc command. They aren't actually TSCs, but they are text based configuration formats, so I'll include them here.

| Format | Status |
|--------|--------|
| cmf    | ✔      |
| cgf    | ✔      |
| cst    | ✔      |

### Audio

These formats are low priority since they can all be played using the instructions on the [FMTK Wiki Asobo Audio Formats page](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk/wiki/Asobo-Audio-Formats). The implementation of these formats is being tracked in [issue #27](https://github.com/widberg/bff/issues/27).
